# Space Invaders - Development Workflow

## How We Work on This Specific Project

This project will follow an iterative development approach. We'll start with a basic implementation of the core gameplay mechanics and gradually add features and enhancements.

## Testing Patterns
- **Manual Testing:** The game will be tested manually throughout development to ensure functionality and identify bugs.  This includes testing player movement, shooting, invader movement, collision detection, and game over conditions.
- **Automated Testing (Future):**  Automated testing will be considered for future iterations to improve efficiency and reduce manual testing effort.
- **Browser Testing:** The game will be tested on different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

## Release Process

1. **Development:** The game will be developed and tested locally.
2. **GitHub Pages Deployment:** The project will be deployed to GitHub Pages for public access.

## Project-Specific Standards
- **Code Style:** We'll follow standard JavaScript coding conventions for readability and maintainability.
- **Testing Strategy:**  A combination of manual and (eventually) automated testing will be used to ensure the game's quality.
- **File Organization:** The project will be organized into logical directories and files.
- **Documentation:** We'll maintain clear and concise documentation for the project.
