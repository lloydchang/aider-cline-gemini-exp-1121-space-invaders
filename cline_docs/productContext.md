# Space Invaders - Product Context

## Why We're Building This

This project aims to recreate the classic arcade game Space Invaders using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). The goal is to provide a fun and engaging gaming experience that can be accessed directly through a web browser, making it easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

## Core User Problems/Solutions

- **Problem:** Lack of easily accessible classic arcade games.
- **Solution:** A web-based version of Space Invaders that can be played on any device with a browser.

- **Problem:** Desire for a nostalgic gaming experience.
- **Solution:** Recreating the classic Space Invaders gameplay and visuals.

## Key Workflows

1. **Game Start:** The game starts with the player's ship at the bottom of the screen and rows of alien invaders at the top.
2. **Player Movement:** The player can move their ship horizontally using the left and right arrow keys.
3. **Shooting:** The player can shoot projectiles at the invaders using the spacebar.
4. **Enemy Movement:** The invaders move horizontally across the screen, gradually descending towards the player.
5. **Collision Detection:** If a projectile hits an invader, the invader is destroyed, and the player scores points. If an invader reaches the bottom of the screen or collides with the player's ship, the game is over.
6. **Scoring:** The player's score is displayed on the screen and increases with each invader destroyed.
7. **Game Over:** The game ends when the player loses all their lives or the invaders reach the bottom of the screen.

## Product Direction and Priorities

The primary focus is on creating a functional and enjoyable version of Space Invaders. Future enhancements could include:

- **Levels:** Adding multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- **Sound Effects:** Incorporating sound effects for shooting, explosions, and other game events.
- **High Scores:** Implementing a high score system to track player progress.
- **Different Enemy Types:** Introducing different types of invaders with varying behaviors and point values.
- **Power-Ups:** Adding power-ups that enhance the player's abilities.
